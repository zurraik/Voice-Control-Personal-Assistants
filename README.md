# Voice-Control-Personal-Assistants
This Python voice assistant recognizes speech commands, opens websites, plays songs, fetches news, and generates AI responses using OpenAI. It uses `speech_recognition`, `gTTS`, and `pygame` for voice input and output. The assistant supports various online services and integrates a music library for quick playback.
